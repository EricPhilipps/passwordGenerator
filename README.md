<h1 align="center">Functionality</h1>

<p>This application starts off by showing a box with a title "Generate a Password", a text box with a default text in it "Your Secure Password" and a button that allows them to start the process of making their own random password. Pressing the button brings up a series of alerts that require input from the user, after each alert is submitted it proceeds to the next.  The first alert asks how long the password should be; it then continues to ask what type of characters they would like to use one by one (Special, Numeric, Uppercase, Lowercase). After all prompts are entered it displays a password in the text box that follows the users input. They can then choose to generate another password. </p>
